# ðŸš€ Rocket Reusability Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch, based on launch parameters retrieved from the official SpaceX API.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To explore and model the historical SpaceX launch data to build a classification model that predicts landing outcomes and supports reusable rocket technology initiatives.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- **SpaceX REST API** for live launch data
- **Power BI** for dashboard visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
Power BI dashboard includes:
- Orbit-wise success rates
- Payload vs. success analysis
- Model accuracy comparison

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- data â†’ Dataset files
- notebooks â†’ Jupyter notebooks for each phase
- visualizations â†’ PNGs and Power BI screenshots
